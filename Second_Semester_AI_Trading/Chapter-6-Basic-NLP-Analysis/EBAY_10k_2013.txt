The risks and
uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our operating results may decline.  Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our
control. Factors that may affect our operating results include the following:

 macroeconomic and geopolitical events affecting commerce generally.  macroeconomic and geopolitical events affecting commerce generally.  It is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings
accurately. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. We do not have
backlog, and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter. Due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues, it is also difficult to forecast income statement
expenses as a percentage of net revenues. Quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall
below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline.  We invest heavily in marketing and promotion, customer support, protection programs, technology and further development of the operating infrastructure for our core and non-core operations. Some of this
investment entails long-term contractual commitments. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may harm our profitability.  Growth rates of our Marketplaces businesses in many of our most established markets have been slower than that for ecommerce generally and
have declined in certain periods. Despite our efforts to stem this loss of market share in these and other markets, we may not be successful. As our growth rates in established markets slow, we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing
users, especially our top buyers and sellers, active and increasing their activity level on our websites in order to continue to grow our business. In addition, our Marketplaces business is facing increased competitive pressure. In particular, the
competitive norm for, and the expected level of service from, Internet ecommerce websites has significantly increased, ranging from improved user experience to greater ease of buying goods to lower (or no) shipping costs to faster shipping times. If
we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce marketplace, particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher service levels (some of which depend on services provided by sellers
on our platforms), our business will suffer.  We have announced changes to our Marketplaces business intended to drive more
sales and improve seller efficiency. Some of the changes that we have announced to date have been controversial with, and led to dissatisfaction among, our sellers, and additional changes that we announce in the future may also be negatively
received by some of our sellers. Given the number of recent changes that we have made to our policies and pricing, it may take our sellers some time to fully assess and adjust to these changes, and sellers may elect to reduce volume while making
such assessments and adjustments or in response to these changes. If any of these changes cause sellers to move their business (in whole or in part) away from our websites or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume or the number of
successful listings, our operating results and profitability will be harmed. We believe that the mix of sales under our traditional auction-style listing format and fixed-price listing format will continue to shift towards our fixed-price format.
Accordingly, we have eliminated some of the features related to our traditional auction-style format and expect others will become less meaningful to, and used less frequently by, our sellers, which would result in a corresponding decrease in
revenues from such features. In addition, we expect that the costs associated with our seller discount programs will increase as more sellers will become eligible for such discounts.  In addition, because a large percentage of PayPal transactions originate on the eBay platform, declines in growth rates in major
Marketplaces markets also adversely affect PayPals growth. The expected future growth of our PayPal, StubHub, and other lower margin businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses have lower gross
margins than our Marketplaces platforms.  The current recession could harm our business.  Our Marketplaces and Payments businesses are dependent on consumer purchases. The current economic downturn has resulted in reduced buyer
demand and reduced selling prices and may reduce the volume of purchases on our Marketplaces platforms and the volume of transactions paid for using our PayPal payment
 
service, all of which would adversely affect our business. In addition, an economic downturn will likely adversely affect our advertising revenues and continue to require us to increase our
reserves for bad debt and transaction losses. In the event of the bankruptcy of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use (such as airline, cruise or concert tickets), PayPal could be liable to the
buyers of such goods or services either through its buyer protection program or through chargebacks. Continuing poor economic conditions will likely continue or exacerbate these trends.  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States but report our financial results in
U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. In connection with its multi-currency service, PayPal fixes exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate
or if exposure reports are delayed. PayPal also holds some corporate and customer funds in non-U.S. currencies, and thus its financial results are affected by the translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars. In
addition, the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into
U.S. dollars upon consolidation. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net income.
Similarly, our net revenues, operating expenses, and net income will be negatively impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, as happened in the second half of 2008. Net revenues in the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009 were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $354.2 million, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Operating income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 was negatively impacted by
foreign currency translation of $179.3 million, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. As exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results, when translated, may differ materially from expectations. In particular, to the
extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Euro, British pound, Korean won, Australian dollar or Canadian dollar, our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments. While from time to time we
enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure, it is impossible to perfectly predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure. In addition, to the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against
the Euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar, cross-border trade related to purchases of dollar-denominated goods by non-U.S. purchasers will likely decrease, and that decrease will likely not be offset by a
corresponding increase in cross-border trade involving purchases by U.S. buyers of goods denominated in other currencies, adversely affecting our business.  In addition, we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. For example, recent reductions in interest rates have reduced our investment income, including income we earn on PayPal customer balances,
which in turn has materially lowered our net interest income.  Bill Me Laters operations depend on lending services
provided by CIT Bank.  We acquired Bill Me Later, a company that facilitates transaction-based credit services by lending
banks, in November 2008. Bill Me Later is neither a chartered financial institution nor is it licensed to make loans in any state. Accordingly, Bill Me Later must rely on CIT Bank (or another chartered financial institution) to extend credit to
customers in order to offer the Bill Me Later service. When a consumer makes a purchase using the Bill Me Later service, CIT Bank extends the credit to the consumer, funds the consumer loan at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant.
Bill Me Later subsequently purchases the receivable related to the consumer loan extended by CIT Bank. Although CIT Bank continues to own each customer account, Bill Me Later owns the related receivable and is responsible for all servicing functions
related to the account. Any termination or interruption of CIT Banks ability to lend could result in an interruption to the Bill Me Later service. In November 2009, CIT Group Inc., the parent company of CIT Bank, filed for bankruptcy under a
prepackaged plan of reorganization, the plan was approved by the bankruptcy court in December 2009 and CIT Group Inc. emerged from bankruptcy on December 10, 2009. If CIT Group is unable to complete the restructuring plan, or if CIT Groups
financial condition otherwise significantly impairs CIT Banks financial condition or operations
 
or if CIT Banks financial condition or operations are adversely affected for any reason, CIT Bank could be placed under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receivership. In the
event of a receivership, the FDIC as receiver could potentially terminate or suspend our commercial relationship with CIT Bank. Bill Me Later has put in place a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution, but if such a
termination or suspension occurs with no or little advance notice from the FDIC, Bill Me Later would be unable to originate any new transactions until the new arrangement was implemented, which might materially and adversely affect Bill Me
Laters business.  A lawsuit has been filed against Bill Me Later in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, alleging that in its relationship with CIT Bank, Bill Me Later is acting as the true lender to customers in violation of various California laws, including the states usury law. We believe that these allegations are without merit
and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. However, this area of law is uncertain and if the lawsuit is successful, Bill Me Later may be required to change its methods of operations, pay substantial damages and reduce some of its charges and fees,
which would likely adversely affect our business.  The listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may
harm our business.  We have received in the past, and we anticipate receiving in the future, communications alleging that
certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks and trade names, or other intellectual property rights. See Item 3  Legal Proceedings below. Although we have sought to
work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites, some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient. Content owners and other intellectual
property rights owners have been active in asserting their purported rights against online companies, including eBay. Allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in threats of litigation and actual litigation against us
from time to time by rights owners, including litigation brought by luxury brand owners such as Tiffany & Co. in the U.S. (where Tiffany & Co. is currently appealing the trial court ruling in favor of eBay), Rolex S.A. and Coty
Prestige Lancaster Group GmbH in Germany, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture in France, LOréal SA, Lancôme Parfums et Beauté & Cie, and Laboratoire Garnier & Cie in several European
countries. The plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold eBay liable for alleged counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties, for tester and other not for resale consumer products and for unboxed and other allegedly nonconforming
products listed on our sites by third parties, for the alleged misuse of trademarks or copyrights in listings or otherwise on our sites, or in connection with paid search advertisements, or for alleged violations of selective distribution channel
laws or parallel import laws for listings of authentic items, or for alleged non-compliance with consumer protection laws. Such plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief and damages. In the aggregate, these suits could result in
significant damage awards and could adversely affect our business. In June 2008, the Paris Court of Commerce ruled in the Louis Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture cases that eBay and eBay International AG were liable for
failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network. The court awarded the plaintiffs approximately
EUR 38.6 million in damages and issued an injunction (enforceable by daily fines of up to EUR 100,000) prohibiting all sales of perfumes and cosmetics bearing the Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Kenzo brands over all worldwide eBay sites to
the extent they are accessible from France. We have taken measures to comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings. A subsequent ruling fined us EUR 1.7 million (the equivalent of EUR 2,500 per day) and indicated we should
employ additional measures to enforce the injunction. These and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices, which could lower our revenue, increase our costs or make our websites less convenient to our customers. Any such results
could materially harm our business.  In addition to litigation from rights owners, we may be subject to regulatory, civil or
criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided in the sale of counterfeit goods. While we have had some early success in defending against such litigation, more recent cases have been based, at least in part, on
different legal theories than those of earlier cases, and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in defending against such litigation. For example, the German Federal Supreme Court has ruled that we may owe duties, under
certain circumstances, to content owners and competitors relating to taking reasonable
 
steps to prevent the listing of illegal, counterfeit, and pirated items. Plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
in the U.S. or as a hosting provider in the European Union under the Electronic Commerce Directive because of the alleged active nature of our involvement with our sellers, and that, whether or not such safe harbors are available, we should be
found liable because we supposedly have not adequately removed listings that are counterfeit or are authentic but allegedly violate trademark law or effectively suspended users who have created such listings. We are constantly seeking to improve and
modify our efforts to eliminate counterfeit and pirated items. These improvements are in response to ongoing business initiatives designed to reduce bad buyer experiences and improve customer satisfaction as well as in response to new patterns we
are seeing among counterfeiters and others committing fraud on our users. Notwithstanding these efforts, we believe that the legal climate, especially in Europe, is becoming more adverse to our positions, which may require us to take actions which
could lower our revenues, increase our costs, or make our websites less convenient to our customers, which may materially harm our business. In addition, a public perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on our sites, even if
factually incorrect, could damage our reputation and our business.  Content owners and other intellectual property rights
owners may also seek to bring legal action against entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items, such as payment companies. To the extent that intellectual property rights owners bring legal action against PayPal based
upon the use of PayPals payment services in a transaction involving the sale of infringing items, including on our websites, our business could be harmed.  We are subject to patent litigation.  We have repeatedly been sued for
allegedly infringing other parties patents. Some of these ongoing suits are described under the heading Item 3  Legal Proceedings below. We are a defendant in other patent suits and we have been notified of several other
potential patent disputes, and expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our Marketplaces and Payments segments as our services expand in scope and complexity. These claims, whether
meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve, and could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business, could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, or could require us to cease conducting
certain operations.  Use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business.  The law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of their users on their service is often challenged in
the U.S. and internationally. We may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful or stolen goods or unlawful services, or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal
liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services. We have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations. In December 2004, an executive of Baazee.com, our Indian subsidiary, was arrested in connection with a
users listing of a pornographic video clip on that website. We continue to contest the charges related to this arrest. Similarly, one of our Korean subsidiaries (IAC), and one of its employees were found criminally liable for listings (which
occurred prior to our acquisition) on IACs website. The German Federal Supreme Court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent prohibited DVDs from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may be
able to enforce this duty. In a number of circumstances, third parties, including government regulators and law enforcement officials, have alleged that our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws, including antiscalping laws with
respect to the resale of tickets, laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items, the fencing of stolen goods, selective distribution channel laws, distance selling laws and the sale of items outside of the U.S. that are regulated by U.S. export
controls.  Although we have prohibited the listing of stolen goods and certain high-risk items and implemented other
protective measures, we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings, any of which could harm our business. Any costs incurred as a result of
 
potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business. Certain manufacturers and large retailers have sought new U.S.
federal and state legislation regarding stolen goods that could limit our ability to allow sellers to use our sites without confirming the source of, and their legal rights to sell, the underlying goods. In addition, from time to time we have
received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of unlawful goods and stolen goods using our services. This negative publicity could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use
our services.  PayPals payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses. These may include
illegal online gambling, fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances, piracy of software and other intellectual property, money laundering, terrorist financing, bank fraud, child
pornography trafficking, prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, and online securities fraud. Recent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities.
Despite measures PayPal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, illegal activities could still be funded using PayPal. Any resulting claims or liabilities could harm our business.  We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service.  As discussed above with respect to certain specific issues, the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information
carried on or disseminated through their services is often unsettled. Claims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark
infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services. Several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability under a number of these theories have been brought against us, as well as
other online service companies. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our service features a Feedback Forum,
which includes information from users regarding other users. Although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for not removing
content posted in the Feedback Forum.  Furthermore, several court decisions arguably have narrowed the scope of the immunity
provided to Internet service providers like us under the Communications Decency Act. For example, the Ninth Circuit has held that certain immunity provisions under the Communications Decency Act might not apply to the extent that a website owner
materially contributes to the development of unlawful content on its website. As our websites evolve, challenges to the applicability of these immunities can be expected to continue. In addition, the Paris Court of Commerce has ruled in the Louis
Vuitton Malletier and Christian Dior Couture cases that applicable laws protecting passive internet hosts from liability are inapplicable to eBay given that the content in question was provided by users under eBays
control and authority. This trend, if continued, may increase our potential liability to third parties for the user-provided content on our sites, particularly in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where laws governing Internet transactions are
unsettled. If we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this
liability, including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings, which would negatively affect our financial results. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits
and legislative proposals could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business.  Government
inquiries may lead to charges or penalties.  A large number of transactions occur on our websites on a daily basis.
Government regulators have received a significant number of consumer complaints about both eBay and PayPal, which, while small as a percentage of our total transactions, are large in aggregate numbers. As a result, from time to time we have been
contacted by
 
various foreign and domestic governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud. PayPal has received inquiries
regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the Federal Trade Commission and regarding these and other business practices from the attorneys general of a number of states. In September 2006, PayPal entered into a settlement agreement
with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay $1.7 million to the attorneys general, shorten and streamline its user agreement, increase educational messaging to users about funding choices, and communicate more
information regarding protection programs to users. We currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to actions that we have taken that are designed to improve the safety of transactions on our websites, most
notably by requiring PayPal to be offered and/or used for certain high-risk transactions or by certain sellers in certain jurisdictions, and we may face similar inquires from other government regulators in the future. For example, the Reserve Bank
of Australia recently reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer PayPal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized Australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal or
other payment methods. Similarly, Bill Me Later has from time to time received customer complaints that could result in investigations into Bill Me Laters business practices by state or federal regulators. As a result of the current credit
crisis, we expect new laws and regulations to be adopted that impose, among other things, additional obligations and restrictions on providers of credit. We are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future, including
under existing or new credit laws or regulations, which may lead to action against us. We have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts, customer support procedures, operating
procedures and disclosures. If one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines or other penalties, or forced to change our operating practices in ways
that could harm our business.  Changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate.
 In April 2009, we announced plans to change the dispute resolution process (which we refer to as resolutions)
for transactions on eBay.com and eBay.co.uk in which a buyer claims the item was not received or the item they received was different from that described in the listing. Previously, buyers with an issue on our eBay.com and eBay.co.uk platform were
generally required to contact the seller directly, and, if they were unable to resolve the issue, to start the resolutions process online via PayPals resolution center. We are in the process of transitioning to a new, on-eBay resolutions
process provided by eBay customer support, which will serve as the primary entry point for buyers on eBay.com and eBay.co.uk who are unable to resolve their disputes with eBay sellers. Among other things, the new resolutions process provides that
eBay will generally reimburse the buyer for the full amount of an items purchase price (including original shipping costs), in cases where the item was not received or the item they received was different from that described in the listing,
and the seller does not provide adequate resolution to the buyer.  We expect that our costs associated with resolutions will
increase as we make these changes to our resolutions policies and process. These changes, together with any further changes that we may make to our resolutions process in the future, may be negatively received by, and lead to dissatisfaction on the
part of, our sellers. These changes may also result in an increase in buyer fraud and associated transaction losses. In addition, eBay does not have the same rights of recoupment against sellers as PayPal, which may result in higher costs to operate
the program.  We are subject to general litigation and regulatory disputes.  From time to time, we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and
significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded and our company has grown larger. We have in the past been forced to litigate such claims. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such
as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Communications Decency Act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online
 
intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. Any claims or regulatory actions against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly
litigation, damage awards, injunctive relief, or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement, require us to change our business practices in expensive ways, require significant amounts of management time, result in the
diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business.  Failure to deal effectively with
fraudulent transactions and customer disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our business.  As a result of a policy
change implemented in October 2008, buyers who pay for transactions on eBay.com with PayPal are protected on eligible transactions for the full amount of an items purchase price (including original shipping) if the buyer does not receive the
goods they purchased or if the goods differ significantly from what was described by the seller, compared to a maximum recovery of $2,000 before October 2008. Furthermore, U.S. sellers on eBay.com have received improved seller protection for
eligible transactions in which the seller is paid with PayPal, in that they are covered against payment reversals due to buyer claims of an unauthorized payment or an item that was not received, so long as the seller follows specified shipping and
handling practices. We have also enhanced our buyer and seller protections in certain eBay international marketplaces. These changes to PayPals buyer and seller protection program could result in future increases and fluctuations in our
Payments transaction loss rate. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, our Payments transaction losses (including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts) totaled $171.5 million and
$180.9 million, representing 0.29% and 0.25% of our net total payment volume in each period, respectively.  In addition, in
2009 we changed the dispute resolution process for transactions on eBay.com and eBay.co.uk, which are described in greater detail above under the caption Changes to our dispute resolution program could increase our costs and loss rate
and which could result in an increase in our combined eBay and PayPal transaction losses.  PayPals highly automated and
liquid payment service makes PayPal an attractive target for fraud. In configuring its service, PayPal continually strives to maintain the right balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and security for customers. Identity thieves
and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as PayPal. We believe that several of PayPals current and former competitors in the electronic
payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud. While PayPal uses advanced anti-fraud technologies, we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will
continue to attempt to circumvent PayPals anti-fraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods. In addition, PayPals service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and PayPal may be required to
reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches. Merchants could also request reimbursement, or stop using PayPal, if they are affected by buyer fraud or other types of fraud.  PayPal incurs substantial losses from merchant fraud, including claims from customers that merchants have not performed or that their goods
or services do not match the merchants description. PayPal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase, from buyer fraud, from erroneous transmissions, and from customers who have closed bank accounts or
have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could potentially result in PayPal losing the right to accept credit
cards for payment. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and result in corresponding decreases in our net total payment volume, in which case our business would further suffer. Bill Me Later
is similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants, users of the Bill Me Later service and third parties handling its user information, which could increase our exposure to transaction losses and reduce the
profitability of Bill Me Laters business. Our Payments business has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms
of fraud or in connection with new product offerings. If these measures do not succeed, our business will suffer.  eBay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites. eBay
periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased. In some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites. eBay also receives complaints from
sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase. Non-payment may occur because of miscommunication, because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item,
or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously in order to harm either the seller or eBay. In some European and Asian jurisdictions, buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time
period. While eBay can, in some cases, suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users, eBay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods, or otherwise make users
whole other than through our limited buyer protection programs. The impact of changes to our dispute resolutions program implemented in 2009 is discussed in more detail above under the caption Changes to our dispute resolution process could
increase our costs and loss rate.  Other than through these programs, eBay does not compensate users who believe they
have been defrauded by other users, although users who pay through PayPal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card company or bank, which in turn will seek reimbursement from PayPal. eBay also periodically receives complaints from buyers
as to the quality of the goods purchased. We expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made. Our liability for these sort of claims is
only beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non-U.S. jurisdictions than it is in the U.S. Litigation involving liability for third-party actions could be costly and time consuming for us, divert
management attention, result in increased costs of doing business, lead to adverse judgments, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us, including
imposing fines or seeking injunctions.  Negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive
conduct by users of our Marketplaces and Payments services could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand names. We believe that negative user experiences are one
of the primary reasons users stop using our services.  Any factors that reduce cross-border trade could harm our business.
 Cross-border trade has become an increasingly important source of both revenue and profits for us. Cross-border
transactions using our websites generally provide higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. We generally earn higher transaction fees for cross-border transactions involving
PayPal, and our Marketplaces business continues to represent a relatively easy way for buyers and sellers to engage in cross-border trade compared with other alternatives. To the extent that any factors result in a net reduction in cross-border
trade, including, among other factors, fluctuations in exchange rates, the application of specific national or regional laws (e.g., selective distribution channel laws and parallel import laws) to users in other countries, or any other factors
impose restrictions on, or increase the costs of, shipping goods across national borders (including customs enforcement and tariffs), our business would suffer.  Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.  To succeed, online commerce must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Our security measures may not detect or prevent security breaches that could harm our
business. Currently, a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. PayPals users routinely provide credit card and other financial information. We rely on
encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit card
 
numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached
or compromised. Other large Internet companies have recently disclosed sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a users password could access the users
transaction data. An increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security. Any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and, therefore, our business, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws.
In addition, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business.
Under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that we store, or that is stored by PayPals direct credit card processing customers, we could be liable to the credit card
issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines or lose our
ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments or pay their fees. If we were unable to accept credit cards, our business would be seriously damaged.  Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, and we have experienced
denial-of-service type attacks on our system that have made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time (most recently involving our Korean IAC website in July 2009). We may need to expend significant resources to
protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate. Security breaches, including any breach by us or by parties with which
we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of our users personal information, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our insurance policies carry low
coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.  Our users, as well as
those of other prominent Internet companies, have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or
to introduce viruses through trojan horse programs to our users computers. These emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by eBay, PayPal, or a user of one of those businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by
the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails through product improvements
and user education, spoof and phishing remain a serious problem that may damage our brands, discourage use of our websites, and increase our costs.  Changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business.
 We are subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable
information about our users, especially for financial information and for users located outside of the U.S. In addition, as an entity licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg, PayPal (Europe) S.A.R.L. et Cie, SCA is subject to
banking secrecy laws. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries, and between ourselves, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we
have commercial relations. New laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. The interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of
flux. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying with these varying
international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning
the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with
 
our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in
proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which
themselves may result in a violation of these laws.  Our revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our control.
 We derive significant revenue from advertising on our websites. Revenues from online advertising are sensitive to events
and trends that affect advertising expenditures, such as general changes in the economy and changes in consumer spending, as well as the effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising media and the value our websites provide to
advertisers relative to other websites. Recent economic conditions have adversely impacted our advertising revenue. In addition, major search engine operators have the ability to change from time to time, at their sole discretion, the rules and
search algorithms governing the pricing, availability, and placement of online advertising. Any changes in these rules or search algorithms could materially reduce the value that we derive from online advertising on our websites, either directly or
indirectly. For example, retailers pay a fee to Shopping.com for online shoppers directed to their websites by Shopping.com. Rule changes made by search engines in 2008 disrupted traffic to our Shopping.com website, which in turn adversely affected
click-through traffic to retailers from our Shopping.com website and associated fee revenue. Furthermore, we have recently changed the placement of ads on our sites, which may reduce the amount we are paid. If we experience a reduction in our
advertising revenues due to economic, competitive, technological or other factors, including the worldwide economic slowdown, a reduction in revenue due to the renegotiation of the terms of our contracts with major advertising companies such as
Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft, changes in our ad placement, or if we are unable to provide value to our advertisers, our business and financial results would suffer.  Our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and these efforts may be costly.  We believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services, and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts across all of our
brands. We will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on, and devote substantial resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users. Since 2005, we have significantly increased
the number of brands we are supporting, adding Shopping.com, our classified websites (e.g., Kijiji, Marktplaats and Den Blå Avis), StubHub, Bill Me Later and Gmarket, among others. Each of these brands requires its own resources, increasing
the costs of our branding efforts. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands. Also, major search engine operators that we use
to advertise our brands have frequently-changing rules that govern their pricing, availability and placement of online advertisement (e.g., paid search, keywords), and changes to these rules could negatively affect our use of online advertising to
promote our brands. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, our business would be harmed.  New and existing regulations could harm our business.  We are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the Internet. It is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership,
copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property issues, parallel imports and distribution controls, taxation, libel and defamation, obscenity, and personal privacy apply to online businesses such as ours. The majority of these laws were
adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Those laws that do reference the Internet, such as the U.S. Digital
Millennium Copyright Act and the European Unions Directives on Distance Selling and Electronic Commerce, are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. Furthermore, as our activities and the types of
goods and services listed on our websites expand, including
 
through acquisitions such as our acquisition of Bill Me Later, a transactional credit provider, in November 2008 and StubHub, an online ticket marketplace, in February 2007, regulatory agencies
or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction, either generally or with respect to certain actions (e.g., the sale of real estate, event tickets, cultural
goods, boats and automobiles). Recent financial and political events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies in general and financial services companies in particular.  Our success and increased visibility has driven some existing businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to their business
to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators. These established businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we
have significant operations. They may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services. In
particular, these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing, parallel imports, professional seller obligations, selective distribution networks, stolen goods, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and
the liability of the provider of an Internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues. In addition, regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past.
Changing the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third-party listings could negatively impact our business.  Over the last few years some large retailers and their trade associations have sought legislation in a number of states and the U.S. Congress that would make eBay liable for the sale of stolen
property or would ban certain categories of goods from sale on our platform, including gift cards and health and beauty products. No such legislation has passed. Nonetheless, the proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation, and if any of
these laws are adopted they could harm our business.  Numerous states and foreign jurisdictions, including the State of
California, where our headquarters are located, have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers. Several states and some foreign jurisdictions, including
France, have attempted, and may attempt in the future, to impose such regulations upon us or our users. Attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and such attempted enforcements could harm our business.
In France, we have been sued by Conseil des Ventes, the French auction regulatory authority. The authority alleges that sales on our French website constitute illegal auctions that cannot be performed without its consent. Although we have won this
lawsuit, this decision is being appealed. A lawsuit alleging similar claims has been brought against us by two associations of French antique dealers. We intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits. However, this and other regulatory and
licensure claims could result in costly litigation and, if successful, could require us to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues (for example, by forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items
for some locations). We could also be subject to fines or other penalties, and any of these outcomes could harm our business.  A number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws. For example, trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control
the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holders consent. The application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the
Internet, and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations, our business could be harmed.  As we expand and localize our international activities, we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate. In addition, because our services are accessible
worldwide, and we facilitate sales of goods to users worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users, or the location of the
product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction. For example, we were found liable in
 
France, under French law in the recent Louis Vuitton Malletier litigation for transactions on our websites worldwide that did not involve French buyers or sellers (see
Item 3  Legal Proceedings below). Laws regulating Internet and ecommerce companies outside of the U.S. may be less favorable than those in the U.S., giving greater rights to consumers, content owners, competitors,
users and other third parties. Compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings, and the imposition of any regulations on our users may harm our business. In addition, we may be
subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us. Our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our
services, in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions.  In light of the global
financial crisis, federal lawmakers in Washington, D.C., have discussed the possibility of overhauling the U.S. financial regulatory system and making significant changes to regulations governing financial services. In the event that such changes
are adopted, they could potentially result in PayPal becoming subject to one or more federal financial services regulators and eBay Inc. being regulated as a financial services holding company or could restrict the nonfinancial activities of
companies holding financial services companies. Even if we do not become subject to regulation in the manner described in the preceding sentence, we could be subject to additional licensure requirements, laws and regulations and increased regulatory
scrutiny based on new or existing businesses, products and offerings, which would impose substantial costs on us and could require us to change our business practices in ways that would harm our business.  If our Payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations, including those governing money
transmission, electronic funds transfers, money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking and lending, it could be subject to liability, licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices.  While PayPal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from 190 markets, PayPal only allows customers in 65 of those
markets (including the U.S.) to receive payments, in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds. These limitations may affect PayPals ability to grow in these markets.  Our Payments business is subject to regulation as a bank in certain jurisdictions. Of the 190 markets whose residents can use the PayPal
service, 31 (27 countries plus four French overseas departments) are members of the European Union (EU). Since 2007, PayPal has provided localized versions of its service to customers in the EU through PayPal (Europe) S.A.R.L. et Cie, SCA, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in Luxembourg. Accordingly, PayPal (Europe) is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure, reporting, anti-money
laundering, capitalization, funds management, corporate governance or other requirements imposed on Luxembourg banks. PayPal has limited experience in operating as a bank, and any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the Luxembourg
regulator could adversely affect PayPals business. PayPal (Europe) implements its localized services in EU countries through an expedited passport notification process through the Luxembourg regulator to regulators in other EU
member states pursuant to EU Directives, and has completed the passport notice process in all EU member countries. The regulators in these countries could notify PayPal (Europe) of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its
business, in addition to Luxembourg consumer protection law, and could also seek to persuade the Luxembourg regulator to order PayPal (Europe) to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office. Any such responses from these
regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, PayPals plans for expanding its business in EU countries. In addition, the EU Payments Service Directive, which established a new regulatory regime for payment services providers, formally took
effect in November 2009. The interpretation of regulations implementing the EU Payments Service Directive remains uncertain.  In markets other than the U.S., the EU, Australia and China, PayPal serves its customers through PayPal Private Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PayPal that is based in Singapore. In many of these markets, it is not
 
clear whether PayPals Singapore-based service is subject to Singaporean law or, if it were subject to local laws, whether such local law would require a payment processor like PayPal to be
licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise. In such markets, the business may rely on partnerships with local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency. Local regulators who do not have jurisdiction over
Singapore-based PayPal Private Ltd, may use their local regulatory power to interfere with, slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local banking partner. Such regulatory actions impacting local banking partner arrangements
could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of PayPal services in that market. The Reserve Bank of India has asserted that PayPals offering of payment services to customers outside of India to
send personal, non-commercial payments to recipients in India requires a license from the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank has directed the Indian affiliate of PayPals processing bank to suspend all withdrawals to the Indian bank accounts of
PayPal customers for both personal and business customers. PayPal has suspended personal non-commercial payments to Indian accounts, and intends to apply for a license from the Reserve Bank of India, but PayPal could be subject to fines from the
Reserve Bank for the period of operation without a license, and PayPals prospects for future business in India, both cross-border and domestic, could be materially and adversely affected.  Even if PayPal is not currently required to be licensed in some jurisdictions, future localization or targeted marketing of PayPals
service in those countries, or expansion of the financial products offered by PayPal to new jurisdictions (either alone, through a commercial alliance or through an acquisition), could subject PayPal to additional licensure requirements, laws and
regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which may harm PayPals business. These factors could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of its products. Delay or failure to receive
such a license or regulatory approval could require PayPal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect PayPals international expansion plans, and could require PayPal to suspend providing products and
services to customers in one or more countries.  PayPal is also subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit, among other things, its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. Although PayPal has implemented a program to comply with these laws and regulations, any errors
or failure to comply with federal, state or foreign money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, and forfeiture of significant assets. Several countries, including
Australia, Luxembourg and Singapore, have recently implemented new anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations, and PayPal has had to make changes to its procedures in response. In November 2009, the Australian
anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulator (AUSTRAC) accepted an enforceable undertaking from PayPal Australia pursuant to which PayPal Australia agreed, among other things, to appoint an independent auditor to assess PayPal
Australias anti-money laundering compliance policies and procedures and issue a report.  In the United States, PayPal is
also subject to regulations that require it to report suspicious activities involving transactions of $2,000, or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of $3,000 or more.
The interpretation of suspicious activities in this context is uncertain. Future regulations under the USA PATRIOT Act may require PayPal to revise the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international
transactions more closely. PayPal has localized its service in a number of other countries and as a result is subject to additional verification and reporting requirements, which in some cases are more stringent. As PayPal continues to localize its
services in additional jurisdictions, PayPal could be required, among other things, to learn more about its customers before opening an account, to obtain additional verification of customers and to monitor its customers activities more
closely. These requirements could impose significant costs on PayPal, make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the attractiveness of its product.  To date, PayPal has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in 42 U.S. states and territories and interpretations in seven
states that licensing is not required under their existing statutes. The remaining U.S. state
 
and territories do not currently regulate money transmitters. As a licensed money transmitter, PayPal is subject to restrictions on its investment of customer funds, reporting requirements,
bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. If PayPal were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations, PayPal could be subject to liability, forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states,
forced to change its business practices, or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on PayPal. Any change to PayPals business practices that makes the service less attractive to
customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could decrease the velocity of trade on eBay, which would further harm our business.  Although there have been no definitive interpretations to date, PayPal has assumed that its service is subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E of the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board. As a result, among other things, PayPal must provide advance disclosure of changes to its service, follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses above $50 from transactions not authorized by the consumer.
PayPal currently voluntarily reimburses consumers for all financial losses from transactions not authorized by the consumer, not just losses above $50. PayPal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants, but PayPal incurs losses
if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its PayPal account.  Our Bill Me Later service is similarly subject to a
variety of laws and regulations. Although Bill Me Later does not originate loans, one or more jurisdictions may conclude that Bill Me Later is a lender or money transmitter or loan broker, which could subject us to liability or regulation in one or
more jurisdictions. Additionally, federal regulators could mandate changes to the relationship between Bill Me Later and CIT Bank, the financial institution that Bill Me Later relies on to extend credit to customers with the Bill Me Later service.
Any termination or interruption of CIT Banks lending services to consumers could result in an interruption of Bill Me Later services, as described under the caption Bill Me Laters operations depend on lending services provided by
CIT Bank above. Also, effective February 2010, certain provisions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, will require CIT Bank to make fundamental changes to many of the practices
currently used with respect to Bill Me Later consumer accounts, including marketing, pricing (including finance charges and fees assessed on receivables purchased by CIT Bank) and billing, which could in turn have an adverse affect on Bill Me
Laters business.  Changes to credit card networks or bank fees, rules, or practices could harm PayPals
business.  PayPal does not belong to or directly access credit card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard. As a result,
PayPal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions, and must pay fees for this service. From time to time, credit card networks have increased, and may increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they
charge for each transaction using one of their cards. PayPals credit card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to PayPal as well as increase their own fees for processing. These higher fees
increase PayPals operating costs and reduce its profit margins. PayPal is also required by its processors to comply with credit card network operating rules, and PayPal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by
credit card networks as a result of any rule violations by PayPal or PayPals customers. The credit card networks set and interpret the credit card rules. Credit card networks could adopt new operating rules or re-interpret existing rules that
PayPal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow. As a result, PayPal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments. If PayPal were unable to accept credit cards, its
business would be seriously damaged. In addition, the velocity of trade on eBay could decrease and our business would further suffer.  PayPal is required to comply with credit card networks special operating rules for Internet payment services. PayPal and its credit card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply
with these rules, but any failure to comply could result in fines, the amount of which would be within the credit card networks discretion. PayPal also could be subject to fines from credit card networks if it fails to detect that merchants
are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high
 
risk, primarily the sale of certain types of digital content. For high risk merchants, PayPal must either prevent such merchants from using PayPal or register such merchants
with credit card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. PayPal has incurred fines from its credit card processors relating to PayPals failure to detect the use of its service by high risk
merchants. The amount of these fines has not been material, but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts, could become material, and could result in a termination of PayPals ability to accept credit cards or
changes in PayPals process for registering new customers, which would seriously damage PayPals business.  Changes in PayPals funding mix could adversely affect PayPals results.  PayPal pays significant
transaction fees when customers fund payment transactions using credit cards, lower payments when customers fund payments with debit cards, nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts, and
no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing PayPal account balance or use buyer credit issued by GE Money Bank. As of October 2009, eligible U.S. customers may also fund payment transactions through a loan originated by CIT
Bank in the Bill Me Later service, and PayPal will incur no fees for such transactions. Customers fund a significant portion of PayPals payment volume using credit cards, and PayPals financial success will remain highly sensitive to
changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit cards. Senders may prefer funding using credit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons, including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly with
their credit card provider if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described, the ability to earn frequent flier miles, cash rebates, or other incentives offered by credit card issuers, the ability to defer payment, or a reluctance to provide
bank account information to PayPal. In addition, some of PayPals offerings, including the ability to make a limited number of payments without opening an account, have a higher rate of credit card funding than PayPals basic product
offering.  PayPals failure to manage customer funds properly would harm its business.  PayPals ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. In some of the markets
that PayPal serves and currencies that PayPal offers, PayPal has a limited operating history and limited management experience in managing these internal controls. As PayPals business continues to grow, it must strengthen its internal controls
accordingly. PayPals success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage customer funds accurately
could severely diminish customer use of PayPals products.  System failures could harm our business.  We have experienced system failures from time to time, and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current
revenues and profits, could harm our future revenues and profits, and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Our eBay.com website has been interrupted for periods of up to 22 hours. In November 2009, technical systems issues resulted in
eBay.com users being unable to search for listed items for a period of several hours. Our PayPal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as five days, most recently for approximately five hours in August 2009. Any
unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable,
leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. Reliability is particularly critical for PayPal, especially as it seeks to expand its Merchant Services business. Because PayPal
is a regulated financial entity, frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to fines, penalties, or mandatory changes to PayPals business practices, and ultimately could cause PayPal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or
prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand. Finally, because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses. These customers could
seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim likely would be time-consuming and costly for us to address.  Although our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce
downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service
attacks, and similar events or disruptions. Some of our systems, including our Shopping.com website and the systems related to the Bill Me Later business, are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all
eventualities. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a
facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and result in lengthy interruptions in our
services. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.  There are many risks associated with our international operations.  Our international expansion has been rapid and our international business, especially in Germany and the U.K., has also become critical to
our revenues and profits. Net revenues outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 54% of our net revenues in both fiscal year 2008 and 2009. Expansion into international markets requires management attention and resources and requires us to
localize our services to conform to local cultures, standards, and policies. The commercial, Internet, and transportation infrastructure in lesser-developed countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our traditional Marketplace
business model. In many countries, we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do, and we may not benefit from first-to-market advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into particular international
markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations. For example, in 2002 we withdrew our eBay marketplace offering from the Japanese market, and in 2007 we contributed our business in China to a joint venture with a local Chinese company.
Even if we are successful in developing new markets, we often expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues for at least 12 months in most countries.  As we continue to expand internationally, including through the expansion of PayPal, Shopping.com, and our classified businesses, we are
increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:

international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, repatriating money without adverse tax consequences, and risks relating to foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations. The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations is discussed in more detail under the caption We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, above.  In addition, we conduct certain functions, including product development, customer support and other operations, in regions outside the
U.S., particularly in India and China. We are subject to both U.S. and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities, and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits, including cost efficiencies and productivity
improvements, associated with providing these functions outside of the U.S. could adversely affect our business.  We are
continuing to expand PayPals services internationally. In some countries, expansion of PayPals business may require a close commercial relationship with one or more local banks, a shared ownership interest with a local entity or
registration as a bank under local law. Such requirements may reduce our revenue, increase our costs or limit the scope of our activities in particular countries. Any limitation on our ability to expand PayPal internationally could harm our
business. The Reserve Bank of India has asserted that PayPals offering of payment services to customers outside of India to send personal, non-commercial payments to recipients in India requires a license from the Reserve Bank. The Reserve
Bank has directed the Indian affiliate of PayPals processing bank to suspend all withdrawals to the Indian bank accounts of PayPal customers for both personal and business customers. PayPal has suspended personal non-commercial payments to
Indian accounts, and intends to apply for a license from the Reserve Bank of India, but PayPal could be subject to fines from the Reserve Bank for the period of operation without a license, and PayPals prospects for future business in India,
both cross-border and domestic, could be materially and adversely affected.  We maintain a portion of Shopping.coms research and development facilities and
personnel in Israel, and in January 2008 we acquired Fraud Sciences Ltd., an Israeli company. As a result, political, economic and military conditions in Israel affect those operations. The future of peace efforts between Israel and its neighboring
countries remains uncertain. Increased hostilities or terrorism within Israel or armed hostilities between Israel and neighboring countries or other entities could make it more difficult for us to continue our operations in Israel, which could
increase our costs. In addition, many of our employees in Israel could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances. Our Israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to
military service, which could adversely affect our business.  Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments could
result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.  We have acquired a number of businesses in the
past, including, most recently, Gmarket in Korea, Bill Me Later in the United States and Den Blå Avis and BilBasen, classified businesses in Denmark. In November 2009, we completed the sale of Skype to an entity (Buyer) owned and
organized by an investor group and received, among other things, an equity stake of approximately 30% of the outstanding capital stock of the Buyer. We expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,
including business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets and strategic investments. At any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more
of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is
itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include:

 diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration,

liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.  Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits
of any or all of our acquisitions, or may not realize them in the time frame expected. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, liabilities, amortization expenses related to
intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill, which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders.  In addition, we have made certain investments, including through joint ventures, in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control. These investments may involve
risks. For
 
example, the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and business decisions or other
actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture.  Bill Me Laters operations expose us to new risks.  Risks associated with Bill Me Laters reliance on CIT Bank are discussed in detail under the caption Bill Me Laters operations depend on lending services provided by CIT Bank above.
 Bill Me Later relies on third-party merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions using the Bill Me Later
service. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 80% of all transaction volume by dollar amount through the Bill Me Later service was settled through the facilities of a single vendor. Any disruption to these third party payment
processing and gateway services would adversely affect the Bill Me Later service. The Bill Me Later service is offered to a wide range of consumers, and the financial success of this business depends on CIT Bank, the chartered financial institution
originating the loan, to manage credit risk. CIT Bank extends credit using Bill Me Laters proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of a specific transaction for
a specific customer. These algorithms and techniques may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due to, among other factors, inaccurate assumptions about a particular consumer or the economic environment. The accuracy of the
predictions and the ability of CIT Bank and Bill Me Later to manage credit risk may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations), competitors actions, changes in consumer behavior
and other factors. CIT Bank may also incorrectly interpret the data produced by these algorithms in setting its credit policies, which may impact Bill Me Laters financial performance. In addition, the credit crisis and current recession in the
U.S. may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce consumers ability or willingness to use credit, including the transaction-based credit extended by CIT Bank to consumers who use the Bill Me Later service, which could impair the
growth and profitability of the Bill Me Later business.  We anticipate that the volume of loans extended by CIT Bank in
connection with the Bill Me Laters service will increase as we begin to enable qualified buyers with a PayPal account to use Bill Me Later as a payment funding option for transactions on eBay.com and on certain merchant websites that accept
PayPal. Like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer loans, the Bill Me Later service faces the risk that after Bill Me Later purchases the receivables related to consumer loans, certain account holders will default on
their payment obligations, making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge-offs. The rate at which receivables were charged off as uncollectible, or the credit loss rate, was approximately 11.14% and 10.66% for the
three months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, respectively. The nonpayment rate among Bill Me Later users may increase due to, among other things, worsening economic conditions, such as the current recession in the U.S., and higher
unemployment rates. Consumers who miss payments on their loans often fail to repay them, and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans. The age and rate of growth of the receivables related to a
consumer loan portfolio also affects the rate of missed payments and loans charged off as uncollectible. Consumers are less likely to miss their payments within the first 12 to 18 months of a loans term. Also worsening economic conditions
typically result in fewer new loans and with fewer loans, the proportion of new loans will decrease and the rate of missed payments and charge-offs in the portfolio will increase, which has historically been the case with Bill Me Later.  We currently fund the purchase of receivables related to Bill Me Later accounts through free cash flow generated from our portfolio of
businesses and from our existing credit agreement. Our existing credit agreement may be adversely affected by the impact of current financial conditions on our counterparties. Our ability to securitize receivables related to Bill Me Later accounts
has been largely eliminated by disruptions in the credit industry generally, and in the securitization markets particularly. If we are unable to fund receivables related to the Bill Me Later business adequately or in a cost-effective manner, the
growth and profitability of the Bill Me Later business could be significantly and adversely affected.  In addition, Bill Me Later faces other risks similar to those faced by PayPal, including the
risk of system failures, security breaches or other loss of customer data, fraud, intellectual property claims, compliance failures, and changes to regulations relating to credit offerings described in these Risk Factors, including under the
captions Government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties and If our Payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations, including those governing money transmission, electronic funds
transfer, money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking and lending, it could be subject to liability, licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices.  Our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes.  The application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt
tax) to ecommerce businesses such as eBay and to our users is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the Internet and ecommerce. In many cases, it
is not clear how existing statutes apply to the Internet or ecommerce. In addition, some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the Internet or some aspect of ecommerce. For example, the State of New York has
passed legislation that requires any out-of-state seller of tangible personal property to collect and remit New York use tax if the seller engages affiliates above certain financial thresholds in New York to perform certain business promotion
activities. Several ecommerce companies are challenging this new law. North Carolina and Rhode Island have also enacted similar laws related to affiliates, and a number of other states appear to be considering similar legislation. While the new laws
in New York, North Carolina and Rhode Island do not specifically apply to our businesses, the proliferation of such state legislation, particularly as many states seek to expand revenues generated from broader taxes, could adversely affect some of
our sellers at some point in the future and indirectly harm our business.  In conjunction with the Streamlined Sales Tax
Project  an ongoing, multi-year effort by U.S. state, and local governments to require collection and remittance of distant sales tax by out-of-state sellers  bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress to overturn the Supreme
Courts Quill decision, which limits the ability of state governments to require sellers outside of their own state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in-state residents. Similar legislation may be considered by the
current U.S. Congress as a way to enable states to increase sales tax revenues and help address significant state budgetary shortfalls caused by the economic downturn. The adoption of any legislation overturning the Quill decision that lacks
a robust small business exemption would result in the imposition of sales taxes, as well as costs associated with complex sales tax collection, remittance and audit compliance requirements on our sellers, would make selling on our websites less
attractive for small retailers, and would harm our business.  From time to time, some taxing authorities have notified us that
they believe we owe them certain taxes. In May 2008, the City of Chicago notified both eBay and StubHub that they are liable for a city amusement tax on tickets to events in Chicago, irrespective of the location of the buyer or seller, and has filed
suit to enforce collection of taxes they claim are due. In March 2009, the court ruled that StubHub is not required to collect and remit the city amusement tax. The City of Chicago has requested reconsideration of this ruling and StubHub has sought
clarification of the ruling relative to the remaining counts as well. In August 2009, the court granted StubHubs motion for reconsideration and entered a final order dismissing the case. In September 2009, the City of Chicago filed an appeal
that is pending. The application of similar existing or future laws could have adverse effects on our business.  Several
proposals have been made at the U.S. state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the Internet. These proposals, if adopted, could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands,
and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities. The U.S. federal governments moratorium on state and local taxation of Internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce was extended
through November 2014. This moratorium does not prohibit federal, state, or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium and/or one of its
extensions.  We do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services. One or more
states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection, reporting or record-keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to
improve tax compliance (and legislation to such effect has been discussed in the U.S. Congress, several states, and a number of foreign jurisdictions) or if an eBay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a
jurisdiction in which eBay operates. In July 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (H.R. 3221) was signed into law. This law contains provisions that require companies that provide payments over electronic means to users to report
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) information on payments received by certain customers. The legislation, effective for payments received after December 31, 2010, will require PayPal and other electronic payments providers, as well as
potentially StubHub and similar companies, to report to the IRS on U.S.-based customers who receive more than $20,000 in payments and more than 200 payments in a year, and to request tax ID numbers from U.S. users and track payments by tax ID
number. This requirement may decrease seller activity and harm our business. One or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax-collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an
ecommerce transaction, regardless of where the respective users are located. Imposition of a discriminatory record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business. Foreign authorities may
also require eBay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws regulating professional sellers, including tax requirements. In addition, we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information
regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites, and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data. The imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax
or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers, especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce, and any use of those records to investigate, collect taxes from, or prosecute
sellers, could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business.  We pay input VAT on applicable taxable purchases
within the various countries in which we operate. In most cases, we are entitled to reclaim this input VAT from the various countries. However, because of our unique business model, the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation
is sometimes uncertain. A successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim VAT could harm our business.  We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify eBays obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. Passage of new legislation and the imposition of
additional tax or tax-related reporting requirements could harm our users and our business. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous
markets in which eBay conducts or will conduct business.  Our decision to launch our PayPal Developer Platform, which is
open to third-party developers, subjects us to new risks.  In 2009, we launched the PayPal Developer Platform to enable
third party developers to access a wide variety of PayPal product and programming code specifications and to connect to select PayPal payment application programming interfaces (APIs). We also began providing a software tool kit for building mobile
payments applications. In addition, we provide third party developers with access to certain APIs with respect to our Marketplaces platforms. There is no assurance that third-party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on
PayPals platforms on a timely basis or at all, and a number of factors could cause such third-party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms. For instance, if we develop our own software applications and services, such
development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive applications on our platforms. The availability and development of these applications also depend on developers
perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for our products versus our competitors products, including devices that use competing platforms. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the
availability and quality of applications for our products may suffer. In addition, we may potentially become subject to additional regulatory scrutiny based on applications developed by third-party developers.  Our businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet. Internet service
providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge us or our users additional fees for our offerings.  Our customers rely
on access to the Internet to use our products and services. In many cases that access is provided by companies that compete with at least some of our offerings, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications
companies, and large Internet service providers. Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customers use of our offerings by restricting or prohibiting the use of their
infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. In addition, Internet service providers could attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings.
Worldwide, a number of companies have announced plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such actions. Interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings, whether paid by us or by our
customers, could cause us to lose existing customers, impair our ability to attract new customers, and harm our revenue and growth.  Our tickets business is subject to regulatory, competitive, and other risks that could harm this business.  Our
tickets business, which includes our StubHub business, is subject to numerous risks. Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations covering the resale of event tickets, and some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the
face value of the tickets, and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposing these or other restrictions may be adopted that could limit or inhibit our ability to operate, or our users ability to continue to
use, our tickets business. Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from
reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions.  Some event organizers and professional sports teams have expressed concern
about the resale of their event tickets on our sites. Suits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past, and may in the future, be filed against StubHub and eBay by venue owners, competitors, ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket
buyers. Such litigation could result in damage awards, could require us to change our business practices in ways that may be harmful to our business, or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets business. Our tickets business is also subject to
seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries. The recent economic downturn has resulted in a decrease in ticket prices sold on our sites and has negatively
impacted revenue and profits. Our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources, including ticketing service companies (such as TicketMaster, Live Nation and Tickets.com), event organizers (such as professional sports
teams and leagues), ticket brokers, and other online and offline ticket resellers, such as TicketsNow (which is owned by TicketMaster) and RazorGator. In addition, ticketing service companies and event organizers have recently begun to issue event
tickets through paperless (electronic) ticketing systems that include restrictions on the transferability of such event tickets. To the extent that event tickets issued in this manner cannot be resold on our websites, or to the extent that we are
otherwise unable to compete with these competitors, our tickets business would be harmed.  We depend on key personnel. 
 Our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and
our ability to retain and motivate them. We do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key personnel, we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies, and some members of our senior management team have fully
vested the vast majority of their in-the-money equity incentives. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business. Our new businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel. Our
future success also will depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, and customer support personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and we may be unable to successfully
attract, integrate, or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-
 
technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations in our stock price may make it more
difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices. Similarly, decreases in the number of unvested in-the-money stock options held by existing employees, whether because our
stock price has declined, options have vested, or because the size of follow-on option grants has declined, may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees.  Problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our business.  A number of parties provide services to us or to our users that benefit us. Such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings, merchant tools that manage listings and interface with
inventory management software, storefronts that help our users list items, caching services that make our sites load faster, and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform, among others. In some cases we have contractual agreements
with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success, while in other cases we have none. PayPal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that link PayPal to the credit card and bank clearing networks. Similarly,
Bill Me Later relies heavily on third parties to operate its services, including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions. Financial or regulatory issues, labor issues (e.g., strikes or work stoppages) or other problems that
prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions or payments on our websites more difficult, and thereby harm our business. In addition, price
increases by companies that provide services to our users (such as postal and delivery services) could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our users to complete transactions, thereby harming our business.
Any security breach at one of these companies could also adversely affect our customers and harm our business.  In addition,
we have outsourced certain functions to third-party outside providers, including customer support and product development functions, which are critical to our operations. If our service providers do not perform satisfactorily, our operations could
be disrupted, which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business, reputation and operating results. Although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with third parties who
provide services to us on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, and there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our users will continue to do so
on acceptable terms. If any third parties were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of bankruptcy due to poor economic conditions, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely
and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.  Customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer
support or anti-fraud measures could diminish use of our services.  Customer complaints or negative publicity about our
customer support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services. Measures we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease
activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users. These measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer
support requires significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle
customer complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer and we may lose our customers confidence.  Because it is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment, PayPal must provide telephone as well as email customer support and must resolve certain customer contacts within
shorter time frames. As part of PayPals program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money laundering, it may
 
temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customers account activity are identified by PayPals risk models as suspicious. PayPal has
in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer support and account restrictions, and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging, among other things, failure to resolve
account restrictions promptly. If PayPal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost-effective manner, PayPals users may have negative experiences, PayPal may receive additional negative publicity, its ability to attract
new customers may be damaged, and it could become subject to additional litigation. As a result, current and future revenues could suffer, and its operating margins may decrease. In addition, negative publicity about, or negative experiences with,
customer support for any of our businesses could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brands as a whole.  Our industry is intensely competitive, and other companies or governmental agencies may allege that our behavior is anti-competitive.  Marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a number of companies providing both particular categories of goods and broader ranges of goods. The Internet provides new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels
for the sale of all types of goods. We expect competition to intensify in the future. The barriers to entry into these channels are relatively low and current offline and new competitors, including small businesses who want to create and promote
their own stores, can easily launch online sites at a nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful ecommerce companies.  Our broad-based competitors include the vast majority of traditional department, warehouse, discount, and general merchandise stores (as
well as the online operations of these traditional retailers), emerging online retailers, online classified services, and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks. Among others, these include: Wal-Mart, Target,
Sears, Macys, JC Penney, Costco, Office Depot, Staples, OfficeMax, Sams Club, Amazon.com, Buy.com, AOL.com, Yahoo! Shopping, MSN, QVC, and Home Shopping Network.  A number of companies offer a variety of services that provide channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes,
including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist (in which we own a noncontrolling equity stake), Google Base, Oodle.com and a number of International websites operated by Schibsted ASA. Our classifieds websites, including
Kijiji, Marktplaats, mobile.de, Gumtree, Den Blå Avis and BilBasen offer classifieds listings in the U.S. and a variety of local international markets. In many markets in which they operate, including in the U.S., our classified platforms
compete against more established online and offline classifieds platforms.  In 2005, we acquired Shopping.com Ltd., an online
shopping comparison site. Shopping.com competes with sites such as Buy.com, Googles Product Search, Nextag.com, Pricegrabber.com, Shopzilla, and Yahoo! Product Search, which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the
Internet for specified products. Recent legal developments may affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers begin requiring more uniformity in product pricing. In addition, sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales
channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on search engine sites such as Google and Yahoo!. We use product search engines and paid search advertising to channel users to our sites, but these
services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations.  We also compete with many local,
regional, and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major categories of products offered on our site. For example, category-specific competitors to offerings in our Business and Industrial category include: Alex Lyon, CAT
Auctions, DoveBid, GoDove, GoIndustry, GovLiquidation.com, Hilco, Ironplanet, JJ Kane, Liquidation.com, MachineryTrader.com, MachineTools.com,
 
Ritchie Brothers, TruckCenter.com, Yoder and Frey Auctioneers. In addition, many competitors have been successful at establishing online marketplaces that cater to a particular retail category,
such as vehicles, tickets, or sporting goods.  Our international Marketplaces websites compete with
similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries. In addition, they compete with general online ecommerce sites, such as Quelle and Otto in Germany, Leboncoin.fr and Price Minister in France, Tradus (owned
by Naspers) in Poland, Yahoo-Kimo in Taiwan, Lotte, Naver and 11th Street in South Korea, Trading Post, OZtion and Aussie Bidder in Australia, and Amazon and Play.com in the United Kingdom and other countries. In some of these countries, there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and
greater brand recognition than we do, and in certain of these jurisdictions there are competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do.  The principal competitive factors for Marketplaces include the following:  

 


may be acquired by, receive investments from, or enter into other commercial relationships with well-established and well-financed companies. As a result, some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to
marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can. Some of our competitors have offered services for free and others may do this as
well. We may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, certain established retailers may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online
channels such as eBay, or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services. For example, manufacturers may attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance
arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our websites or on the Internet generally, or at prices that would make our site attractive relative to other alternatives. The adoption by manufacturers or government authorities of policies or
regulations discouraging the sales of goods or services over the Internet could force eBay users to stop selling certain products on our websites. Increased competition or anti-Internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced
operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value of our brand. In order to respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be
controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among a number of our sellers, and which could harm our profitability.  Conversely, other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future
allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the U.S. or other countries, or otherwise constitute unfair competition. Such claims, even if without foundation, typically are very expensive to defend, involve negative
publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort, and could result in significant judgments against us.  In
several jurisdictions, we have taken actions designed to improve the safety of transactions on our websites. Beginning in June 2008, we have required users in the UK to offer PayPal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized UK
website, and since October 2008, we have required sellers on eBay.com to accept one or more accepted payment methods (currently PayPal, credit or debit cards processed through Internet merchant accounts, ProPay, Moneybookers and Paymate) and no
longer allow any forms of paper payment, including checks and money orders, to be listed by sellers in the U.S. for most categories of items. While these initiatives are intended to improve and make safer our users buying experience
and/or increase activity on our sites, certain users may be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes. We currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to such actions. For example, in 2009,
the Reserve Bank of Australia reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer PayPal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized Australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting
PayPal or other payment methods. We may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future. Any negative reaction to these changes by our users or government authorities could, among other things, force us to change our operating
practices in ways that could harm our business, operating results and profitability. In addition, certain competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping or other transaction related services, which could be impractical or inefficient for
eBay sellers to match. New technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer a lower cost service.  Although we have established Internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies, these arrangements may not be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or these
companies may decide to promote competitive services. Even if these arrangements are renewed, they may not result in increased usage of our services. In addition, companies that control user access to transactions through network access, Internet
browsers, or search engines, could promote our competitors, channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites, attempt to restrict our access, or charge us substantial fees
for inclusion. Search engines are increasingly becoming a starting point for online shopping, and as the costs of operating an online store continue to decline, online sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels, which could reduce
the number and value of transactions these sellers conduct through our sites.  The markets for PayPals product are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change, including but not limited to:
mobile payments, electronic funds transfer networks starting to allow Internet access, cross-border access to networks, creation of new networks, expansion of prepaid cards, and bill pay networks. PayPal competes with existing online and offline
payment methods, including, among others:

Fargo; and payment gateways, including CyberSource and Authorize.net (which has merged with CyberSource);  credit card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants, including American Express, Chase Paymentech, First Data, and Wells

 Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical,
marketing, customer service and other resources, greater name recognition, or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than PayPal. PayPals competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements
faster and more effectively than PayPal. Some of these competitors may also be subject to lesser licensing, anti-money laundering, and other regulatory requirements than PayPal, which is subject to additional regulations based on its licensure as a
bank in Luxembourg. They may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services than PayPal, and they may offer lower prices. For example, Google Checkout has offered free payments processing on transactions in
an amount proportionate to certain advertising spending with Google. Competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of
their services than PayPal.  Overseas, PayPal faces competition from similar channels and payment methods. In each country,
numerous banks provide standard online credit card acquiring and processing services, and these banks typically have leading market share. In addition, PayPal faces competition from Visas Visa Direct, MasterCards MoneySend, Royal Bank of
Scotlands World Pay, Moneybookers, ClickandBuy and Ukash in the EU, NOCHEX in the United Kingdom, Sofortüberweisung in Germany, CertaPay and HyperWallet in Canada, Paymate, BPay and POLI in Australia, Alipay, YeePay and 99 Bill in
China and Inicis in South Korea. In addition, in certain countries, such as Germany and Australia, electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions. As in the U.S., established banks and other
financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service.  Some of
PayPals competitors, such as Wells Fargo, First Data, American Express, and Royal Bank of Scotland, also provide processing or foreign exchange services to PayPal. If PayPal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers, either
alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition, these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be negatively affected, or these competitors and other processors could make it more difficult for PayPal to deliver its services.
 Our business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites, including
seasonal factors, national events and increased usage of other websites.  Anything that diverts our users from their
customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business. We would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war, the threat of war, or terrorist activity, and natural disasters, such as hurricanes or
earthquakes. Similarly, our results of operations historically have been seasonal because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months, and on and around national holidays. In
addition, increased usage of social networking or other entertainment websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our websites, which could adversely affect our financial results.  Our failure to cost-effectively manage certain aspects of our business could harm us.
 We have expanded our headcount, facilities, and infrastructure in the U.S. and internationally, and anticipate that
further expansion in certain areas will be required for some of our businesses. This expansion has placed, and we expect it will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. The areas that are put
under strain by our growth include the following:  

 

 
 Website Usability. User activity rates on our websites depend in part on the quality of our users experiences on those sites. The
rapid growth in the number and complexity of products and features on our sites has occasionally caused users to become confused or overwhelmed or has otherwise impaired users experiences on those sites. We are in the process of making
numerous improvements to our eBay websites, including an attempt to improve the user experience on those websites. These attempts at improvement could fail, or could decrease activity among users who had grown used to or preferred the existing
experience on our sites. Any impairment of customer satisfaction as a result of site usability issues could lead to a loss of customers or impair our ability to add customers, either of which would harm our business.


 
 Website Stability. We must constantly add new hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use
of our and our subsidiaries websites and the new products and features we regularly introduce. This upgrade process is expensive, and the increased complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple platforms as our portfolio of
brands grows increases the cost of additional enhancements. Failure to cost effectively upgrade our technology, features, transaction processing systems, security infrastructure, or network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic or
transaction volume or changes to our site functionality could harm our business. Adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of customer support, impaired quality of users
experiences of our services, impaired quality of services for third-party application developers using our externally accessible APIs and delays in reporting accurate financial information. We may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our
systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems, and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites. Further, steps to increase the reliability and
redundancy of our systems are expensive, reduce our margins, and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.  Website Stability. We must constantly add new hardware, update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use

 Customer Account Billing. Our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes. Our failure to grow our transaction-processing
capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on any of our websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue.  Customer Account Billing.

capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on any of our websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue.  

 

 
 Customer Support. We seek to become more efficient in providing our customer support operations. We intend to provide an increased level of
support (including an increasing amount of telephone support) in a cost-effective manner. If we are unable to provide customer support in a cost-effective manner, users of our websites may have negative experiences, current and future revenues could
suffer, our costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease.  Customer Support. We seek to become more efficient in providing our customer support operations. We intend to provide an increased level of
support (including an increasing amount of telephone support) in a cost-effective manner. If we are unable to provide customer support in a cost-effective manner, users of our websites may have negative experiences, current and future revenues could
suffer, our costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease.  We must continue to effectively
hire, train, and manage new employees. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be
harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to improve our transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls. This is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with
different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Any capital investments that we may make will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for
us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term.  We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.  The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to
reduce our effective tax rate. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits and reviews by taxing
authorities throughout the world, including with respect to our tax structure. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, and the ultimate tax outcome may
differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we
believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient in the event that any taxing authority is successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our positions.  In addition, the economic downturn has reduced tax revenues for U.S. federal and state governments, and proposals to increase taxes from
corporate entities are being considered at various levels of government. Among the options have been a range of proposals included in the tax and budget policies recommended to the U.S. Congress by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to modify the
federal tax rules related to the imposition of U.S federal corporate income taxes for companies operating in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. If such proposals are enacted into law, this could increase our effective tax rate. A number of
U.S. states have likewise attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence in order to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence
in their state. Companies that operate over the Internet, such as eBay, are a target of some of these state efforts. If more states were successful in applying direct taxes to Internet companies that are not present in the state, this could increase
of our effective tax rate.  We depend on the continued growth of online commerce.  The business of selling goods over the Internet, particularly through online trading, is dynamic and relatively new. Concerns about fraud,
privacy, and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the Internet as a medium of commerce. In countries such as the U.S., Germany and the U.K., where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some
time and the level of market penetration of our services is high, acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past. In order to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who
historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer Internet analogues to such traditional retail means to our offerings, such as the retailers own website. If these consumers prove to be less active than our
earlier users, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new customers, our business could be adversely impacted.  Our business depends on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure.  The success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data
capacity, and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable Internet access and services. The Internet has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the numbers of users
and amount of traffic. The Internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands. In addition, increasing numbers of users, increasing bandwidth requirements, or problems caused by viruses, worms, malware and similar
programs may harm the performance of the Internet. The backbone computers of the Internet have been the targets of such programs. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its
infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future.
 
These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services, which could adversely impact our business.  We may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately.  We regard the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets as critical to our success. We
aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our
proprietary rights in products and services. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit
access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available, and contractual arrangements and the other steps we have
taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.  We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress, and trade secret
protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not
be successful in every location. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as
trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.  We are subject to the risks of owning real property.  We own real property,
including land and buildings related to our operations. We have little experience in managing real property. Ownership of this property subjects us to risks, including:

Some anti-takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock.  Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences, rights
and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Some provisions
of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These include provisions that provide for a classified board of
directors, prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination
with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder,
 
unless certain conditions are met. This restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.
